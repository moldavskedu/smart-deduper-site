  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>Smart Deduper is a Google Sheets add-on that helps users find and clean duplicate data. 
  This policy explains how the add-on accesses, uses, protects, and retains user data.</p>

  <h2>1. Data Access</h2>
  <p>Smart Deduper requests access only to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets.currentonly</strong> – to read and update the currently open spreadsheet only.</li>
    <li><strong>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/script.container.ui</strong> – to display the add-on’s sidebar and dialogs inside Google Sheets.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>No other Google services or files are accessed. No personal information, Drive files, or emails are requested.</p>

  <h2>2. Data Use</h2>
  <p>The accessed spreadsheet data is used solely to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Identify and highlight duplicate rows.</li>
    <li>Provide results back to the same spreadsheet at the user’s request.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Data is processed entirely within the user’s Google account and is not transmitted to external servers.</p>

  <h2>3. Data Protection</h2>
  <p>Smart Deduper does not collect, transmit, or store user data. All processing occurs locally within Google Sheets. 
  Because no data leaves the Google environment, there is no risk of unauthorized external access.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
  <p>Smart Deduper does not retain any user data. When the user closes the spreadsheet or removes the add-on, 
  no copies of their data remain. The user can delete any results written by the add-on directly in their spreadsheet at any time.</p>
